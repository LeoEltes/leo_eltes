description: This visual is also a generative composer. By loading live data from
VÃ¤sttrafik (the provider of public transport on the Sweden's west coast) and mapping
that data to several synths the music always changes depending on where the
trains and buses currently are in the world. The tone of every synth is
decided by the location of the vehicles. To minimize (and to romanticize)
the amount of data input I've chosen an area that roughly covers the central parts
of my home town Kungsbacka (and the bus station just beside my family home).
