  title: Bedroom Productions
  date: 17/9-2018
  description: 6 track EP recorded and produced in Leo's bedroom with sonic inspiration taken from artists such as Nils Frahm, James Blake and Bon Iver. The thought process behind the EP was to create music that requires to be put in a context to create a full listening experience. What that context consists of, is up to the listener to decide. Our perception of music may be heavily influenced by our mood and surrounding, that is why this EP was created as a complementary to those moments.
