  title: 42 Guitars
  description: This visual is interactive, the circles will follow your cursor as you move it. The song will start playing as soon as you move the cursor and if the song ends, just move the cursor again to start it. You can press and hold down the mouse to create more circles, and release to go back to the starting amount. If you are on mobile, I do not recommend playing this visual. The visual contains a lot of changing colors in a high pace, beware of epileptic seizure
